\section*{CSCE 156 - Lab 5.0 - Inheritance - Worksheet}

Names: \underline{\hspace{10cm}}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Complete Activities 1--3 and demonstrate your working design 
  and program to a lab instructor. 
  ?  \item Explain, in your own words the advantages of defining and using 
  an interface.  In particular, what was the advantage of defining 
  \mintinline{java}{Payable} as an interface with respect to the 
  \mintinline{java}{Supplier} class you created?

  \item Though you had several different subclasses of 
  \mintinline{java}{Employee}, each one was able to be stored in 
  the same \mintinline{java}{ArrayList} in \mintinline{java}{PayrollReport}.  
  Explain why/how this is possible. 
  
  \item You may have noticed that Eclipse has code completion abilities: 
  type a variable name followed by a dot and several method options will 
  pop up.  You may have also noticed that many of these methods 
  (\mintinline{java}{toString()}, \mintinline{java}{wait()}, etc.) 
  are methods that you did not define in your own classes.  
  Where are these methods coming from?
